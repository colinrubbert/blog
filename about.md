My name is Ben Orenstein.

I work at [thoughtbot](http://thoughtbot.com) in Boston, enjoy [speaking at
conferences](http://www.confreaks.com/presenters/780-ben-orenstein), host a
plucky little [podcast](http://giantrobots.fm), and co-created
[Trailmix](http://www.trailmix.life).

This is [me on github](http://github.com/r00k). I have some
[dotfiles](http://github.com/r00k/dotfiles) you might like.

You can also [follow me on Twitter](http://twitter.com/r00k).
