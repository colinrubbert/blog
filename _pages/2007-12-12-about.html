<h2>About me</h2>
<p>My name is Ben Orenstein.</p>
<p>I work at <a href="http://thoughtbot.com">thoughtbot</a> in Boston, enjoy speaking at conferences, and host a plucky little <a href="http://learn.thoughtbot.com/podcast">podcast</a>.</p>
<p>This is <a href="http://github.com/r00k">me on github</a>. I have some dotfiles you might like.</p>
<p>I tweet mostly about ruby and vim here: <a href="http://www.twitter.com/r00k">@r00k</a></p>
<p>You can email me at <a href="mailto:ben.orenstein@gmail.com">ben.orenstein@gmail.com</a>.</p>
<h2>A note about the writing on this blog</h2>
<p>When I write "It is unprofessional to write code without tests", please read "In my opinion, based on my extremely limited knowledge of the world and my many conscious and unconscious biases, writing code without tests is unprofessional in cases without extenuating circumstances."</p>
<p>I write the former because it's faster and reads better. If it seems like I'm being an arrogant know-it-all about something, please just expand my statements into something more like the latter.</p>
