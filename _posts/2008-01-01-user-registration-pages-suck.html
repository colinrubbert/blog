<p><strong>Summary: you must relentlessly streamline the process by which a user joins your site and avoid even this process as long as possible.</strong></p>
<p>In marketing lingo, it's called your 'conversion rate.'  This is the percentage of users who you successfully convince to take some action.  On the web, this usually means getting someone to</p>
<ol>
<li>Click your ads.</li>
<li>Create an account, or</li>
<li>Buy your product.</li>
</ol>
<p>Today I'd like to focus specifically on the second goal.  This is a topic that has not been getting enough coverage.  I see the same mistakes being made on hundreds of sites, and they have significant impact on the user experience.</p>
<p>Let's start with an example.</p>
<p>Just this morning I read a blog entry on TechRepublic that I enjoyed.  I was so impressed I decided to click the 'thumbs up' button to cast a positive vote for the entry.</p>
<p>Oops.  <em>"Access to this feature requires a free TechRepublic membership! Not a member? Click here to join now."</em></p>
<p>Bad already.  I've tried to interact with this site in the tiniest way, and it is already committing the cardinal sin in sales and flirting: trying to close too quickly.</p>
<p>Slow down guys.  I'm not <em>ready</em> to make an account yet.  I just want to get to know you a little bit.</p>
<p>This is where I usually give up on a site.  I did want to test out a feature or two, but I'm not invested enough to take the time to hand over my information and create yet another account.</p>
<p>However, for the sake of science, this time I pressed on.  Here's TechRepublic's registration page:</p>
<p><img src="assets/tech_republic_registration.png" alt="TR Registration" height="861" width="544" /></p>
<p>Wow!  FOURTEEN required fields PLUS two "please spam me" check-boxes that are helpfully selected by default.  This image is 860 pixels tall and you still can't even see the submit button yet.</p>
<p>Why oh why make this so hard?  Attention spans on the web are notoriously short, yet this site insists that 'company size' be a required field.  I disagree.  TechRepublic does <em>not</em> need to know my company size for me to vote up that blog post, they want that information so they can sell it to their partners.</p>
<p>I feel dirty now.  Let's take a cleansing look at a <em>good</em> registration page:</p>
<p><img src="assets/reddit_registration.png" alt="Reddit Reg" height="504" width="337" /></p>
<p>Ahhhh, much better.  Four required fields, and one is just a captcha to make it hard for bots to create a billion accounts.  There's a field for an email address, but it's <em>optional</em>!  These are requests I'm willing to fulfill.</p>
<p>Let's wrap up with some straightforward advice:</p>
<ol>
<li>Think of forcing your users to register as a last resort. Deliver as many features as possible without registration.</li>
<li>Do not withhold features from unregistered users to convince them to register.   (Under certain business models, this may be unavoidable.)</li>
<li>When users do register, streamline the process as much as possible.  One page maximum!</li>
<li>Keep required fields to a minimum.  If you'd like more detailed information, allow users to enter it through a different page later on (optionally!)</li>
<li>Consider eliminating password complexity requirements.  If you're not holding sensitive data for them, let your users use any old password they prefer.</li>
</ol>
<p>Happy New Year everyone.</p>
<p><strong>Edit: yes, my comment boxes have name/website/email fields.  All these fields are optional.</strong></p>
