<p>I have two passions into which I love to invest my time: go and volleyball.<br id="torz" /><br id="torz0" /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(board_game)">Go</a> is a strong contender for world's oldest game.  It's a strategy game played on a wooden board with black and white stones.  Volleyball is, of course, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8u8CqElOpw">volleyball</a>.  <br id="nqsk" /><br id="nqsk0" />I started these activities right around the same time, eighteen months ago.    Since then, I've gotten quite a bit better at both.  I'm not quite a grizzled vet yet, but I'm on my way. <br id="p67b" /><br id="chp9" />The process by which we gain new skills fascinates me, and <strong>I've paid careful attention to exactly how I got better</strong> at these two activities.  Despite their differences, the answer to both is the same: <strong>proper practice</strong>.<br id="ka8v" /><br id="ka8v0" />When I say proper practice I mean engaging in activities that drill you on the fundamentals of your task.  Proper practice in go is solving go problems.  Go problems lay out a situation that could occur in a game and ask you to find the very best move, over and over again in hundreds of scenarios.<br id="zg:j" /><br id="jqtb" />Proper practice in volleyball is called peppering.  To pepper, you stand six or seven paces from a partner and pass, set, and hit the ball back and forth between you as accurately as possible.  In a peppering session it's not uncommon to have hundreds of repetitions of these actions.  <br id="xcor" /><br id="rsdu" />Having carefully observed my process of improvement in these activities, <strong>I've noticed two things I think are worth sharing</strong>.<br id="nsa_" /><br id="nsa_0" />First, <strong>nothing improves you faster than dump-trucks full of repetitions</strong>.  When I go to pass the ball to my setter in a game, there is simply no substitute for having done that particular move a thousand times before in the field by my house.  Those thousand reps are the key to my consistency.  <br id="p.01" /><br id="p.010" />Second, <strong>proper practice is working on the hard stuff.</strong>  Go problems are broken out by skill level, and after a while, the answers to beginner problems come instantly; they're burned into your firmware.  These are not the problems to practice with.  The ideal problems are those you can solve only with some effort.  <strong>It is exactly while you are exerting this effort that you are getting better</strong>.  <br id="jyhb" /><br id="jyhb0" />I think you can use these ideas to help discover proper practice for nearly any activity.  Consider them litmus tests to see if you've found a worthwhile routine.  Ask yourself: are you getting in lots and lots of reps of things that are hard for you?<br id="t0qp" /><br id="t0qp0" />If so, you're about to get a whole hell of a lot better.</p>
