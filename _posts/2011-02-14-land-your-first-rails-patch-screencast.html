<p>Last week I posted <a href="http://codeulate.com/2011/02/how-to-land-your-first-patch-in-rails/">How to land your first patch in Rails</a>. </p>

<p>The post was well-received, but one commenter asked if I might put together more-detailed steps on how to make your first docpatch. Well, I've done just that, and the result is the screencast below.</p>

<p>It's only 4 minutes, but contains everything you need to know to get your name on the <a href="http://contributors.rubyonrails.org/">Rails Contributors</a> list. Check it out!</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: in the screencast, I mention that you need to message lifo for commit access to docrails. However, as Xavier noted below, docrails now has public write access for everyone, so need to perform that step.</p>
