<p>A quick follow-up.</p>
<p>My <a href="http://codeulate.com/?p=3" title="Reddit is broken">last post</a> regarding reddit ran just over a thousand words.  I should be able to replicate that message with just one picture, but it turns out I need two.</p>
<h3><strong>This is my 'disliked' page on reddit.  These are the links that I've downvoted most recently:</strong></h3>

<h3><strong>And this is my current "recommended" page:</strong></h3>

My voting on Ron Paul links is very regular--I've been downvoting them like mad as an experiment for this post.  I've been doing this for more than two weeks now, so even if there is a lag before the engine updates that couldn't explain this performance.  I hypothesized that maybe recommendations are only made on links I vote <em>up.  </em>But similar testing seems to shoot that down as well: I love <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a> links and vote them up like crazy, but of the 46 stories submitted in the last two weeks with Ruby in their titles, I am recommended none of them.</p>
<p>In fact, of the links reddit has recommended, <em>none </em>seem to contain words I've voted up, but words I vote down with regularity are prominent.  Not only that, I was actually recommended a link that <em>I'd already voted down. </em></p>
<p>I'd like to file a bug report please...</p>
