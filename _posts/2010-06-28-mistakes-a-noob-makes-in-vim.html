<h2>A noob uses the arrow keys.</h2>
<p>The First Commandment of vim is "Thou shalt not use the arrow keys, for they be too far from thy holy home row. Use instead the blessed h, j, k and l."</p>
<h2>A noob does not know his motions.</h2>
<p>When a noob deletes a word, he holds 'x'.</p>
<p>When a master deletes a word, he taps 'dw'.</p>
<p>A noob should learn the motions granted him by w, i, t, f, and a. His practice would be guided well by the writings in ':help motion.txt'</p>
<h2>A noob does not know the '.' command.</h2>
<p>And great is his needless suffering.</p>
<h2>A noob does not record macros.</h2>
<p>A master's q key is well-worn.</p>
<h2>A noob writes Rails code with vim, unaware of <a href="https://workshops.thoughtbot.com/products/2-vim-for-rails-developers">this screencast</a>.</h2>
<p>A master does not hesitate to share his awesome content.</p>
