<p>Well, technically got it's got POSIX-compliant-fu. But that's even better; so no worries.</p>
<p>Check out this line from bundler's <a href="https://github.com/carlhuda/bundler/blob/1-0-stable/bundler.gemspec">gemspec</a>. The goal of this line is to set s.test_files to an array of file located in testing-related directories:</p>
<p><code lang="ruby"><br />
s.test_files = `git ls-files -- {test,spec,features}/*`.split("\n")<br />
</code></p>
<p>There are a couple interesting things going on in this line:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>git ls-files</strong>: by default, this command outputs all the files in the index, but we're going to constrain it with a path supplied by...</li>
<li><strong>{test,spec,features}</strong>: this is a "curly brace expansion". In bash (and other POSIX shells), this will expand to "test spec features", however notice that we've got a trailing...</li>
<li><strong>/*</strong>: when you've got leading or trailing characters around expansions, they are included in the expansion. So the full command of {test,spec,features}/* expands to "test/* spec/* features/*"</li>
<li>Finally, git ls-files outputs the names of all the files in those directories, and we split them on newlines to get our array.
</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, if you like the idea of curly brace expansions, but prefer to stay in Ruby-land, you can have the best of both worlds:<br />
<code lang="ruby"><br />
Dir.glob("{test,spec,features}/*") # This also works<br />
</code></p>
