<p>Change is afoot...</p>
<p>Within a few moments of President Obama being sworn in, a new <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov">whitehouse.gov</a> was revealed.Â  The new site looks great, and promises greater transparency about the actions of our President and government.</p>
<p>Along those lines, check out <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/robots.txt">its robots.txt file</a>, in entirety:</p>
<blockquote><p>User-agent: *<br />
Disallow: /includes/</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Compare this to <a href="http://www.codeulate.com/misc/old-robots.txt">the robot.txt from Bush's era</a></strong>, and I think you've got a lovely little microcosm; one that points to a hopeful, and open future.</p>
