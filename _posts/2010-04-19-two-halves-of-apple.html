<p>On the one hand, you have people starting blogs just to study the tiny trickle of Steve's public emails.  This is an act of yearning.  Steve Jobs' blog would be an instant sensation.</p>
<p>On the other, you have this: Steve Jobs is Willy Wonka.  He <em>won't</em> let you inside his chocolate factory and he<em> </em>is <em>unreachable</em> from the outside world.  The factory is cloaked in secrecy.</p>
<p>And then come demo days, when we all get to see something delightful.There's something a little bit special about this experience, and I'm not sure I want it to change.  A commenter on Hacker News mentioned that he was disappointed to have seen the 4G prototype before its official release, and I know what he means.</p>
<p>I think I'd like to see a more-open Apple, but I can't help but enjoy a helping of the big reveal.</p>
