<p>In the dozens of conferences I've attended, I've almost never seen a
40-minute talk that wouldn't have been better with 10 minutes of junk cut
out.</p>

<p>Conference organizers think they are doing speakers a favor by giving them
ample of time to cover their topic, but I believe this is mistaken. It is far
better to give speakers too little time than too much. The first forces them to
present the essentials quickly and leaves the audience wanting more. The second
makes one worry about filling time. You can guess which leads to better
talks.</p>

<p>When I coach speakers, my advice is almost always "get to the point faster,
then stay there." Shorter slots encourage this positive behavior.</p>

<p>If you take this principle to the extreme, you get lightning talks; often
only 5 minutes long. These are nearly always a highlight of a conference.
Speakers have no time for wandering introductions or apologies, and instead
dive immediately into their best stuff. Then, before you have a chance to get
bored, they're forced to wrap up. If you're interested in learning more, a
quick Googling does the trick. This, by the way, is what I think conference
talks are best at: providing just enough information to convince you to
research something more deeply.</p>

<p>Shorter slots help a speaker focus their material, but they have another
benefit: eliminating the colossal challenge of holding an audience's attention
for long periods of time.</p>

<p>In my experience, there are maybe one or two speakers per conference who can
keep an audience engaged for 40 minutes. The speakers that can't are not
necessarily bad, they've just been giving an incredibly hard task. Consider
this: nearly every attendee has a laptop. Speakers are competing against the
<em>internet</em> amongst a group that will switch to a browser if their tests
take more than 2 seconds to run.</p>

<p>If I were king of the world, I'd make 30 minutes the absolute maximum talk
length. New speakers start with 5-minute lightning talks until they prove they
can handle more.</p>

<p>As always, there are exceptions to this rule: some speakers can plumb deep
topics in entertaining fashion for 40 minutes. But for every speaker I've seen
who can pull this off, I've watched twenty more slowly lose the room to
Twitter, Hacker News, and the irresistable appeal of unread emails.</p>
