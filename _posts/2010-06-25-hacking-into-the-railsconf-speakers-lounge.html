<p>A few months ago, I decided I really, REALLY wanted to speak at RailsConf this year. But I had a problem: I had literally never given a technical talk in my life. I had no proof at all that I would be a good speaker.</p>
<p>I submitted a proposal and made it as compelling as possible, but I knew my chances were slim: RailsConf organizers receive more than 300 proposals for just 50 speaking slots. I even found out there was at least one other person who'd proposed the SAME topic! I desperately needed to do something to improve my odds.</p>
<p>So I hacked the process.</p>
<p>Years ago I desperately wanted a summer internship at a technology company. It was 2000, the height the insanity, and I wanted to be part of it, 17 years-old or not. I had some self-taught networking skills, but absolutely no formal qualifications.  I knew mailing out resumes would be fruitless, so I decided to go door-to-door and cold-call some companies.</p>
<p>This worked perfectly. Haha! Just kidding! It was a miserable failure: I got rejected. A lot.</p>
<p>These were not promising rejections in which I almost got the gig. They were full-stop, no-fucking-ways. I literally never got past a receptionist. Without fail, I was told "you can leave a resume with me" which is Receptionist for "...and waste both our time." Shockingly, I never heard back from 3com despite my impressive lifeguarding experience.</p>
<p>So I did this for a couple days and got nowhere. Finally I had a realization: Cisco can pay a receptionst to carefully shred my resume after I'm gone, but a startup can't afford that sort of luxury. I started seeking smaller prey. Finally, I found my perfect target in small but new offices, big enough to have a logo on the door but NO receptionist!</p>
<p>Honestly? I was scared. I'd never made it past the front desk before, and I almost turned back in panic.</p>
<p>In that moment, the universe tossed me some good luck: a friendly employee asked if I needed help, and cheerfully directed me to HR.</p>
<p>I reached the HR "department" (one woman, one office) and pitched myself as best I could: "I've got no experience, but I love computers and have set up little networks at my house, and I'm great with troubleshooting! And...I'd like to work here."</p>
<p>To my utter shock, she was looking at me...thoughtfully! Her next words couldn't have been better if I'd scripted them: "well actually, we've been talking about hiring someone junior to provide extra support to our existing IT guy. Wait here a minute."</p>
<p>When she returned, she brought me to a conference room where I met the IT director, who liked me.</p>
<p>I was next asked to speak to the VP of Engineering. His only question: "you really just walked in our front door looking for a job?"</p>
<p>"I did."</p>
<p>"That's great. We're gonna make you an offer."</p>
<p>I was hired as a summer intern, making NINE FUCKING DOLLARS AN HOUR! Ludicrous money! More importantly, they had just closed $20 million in funding, and I spent the summer playing with some of the hottest technology available. That internship bootstrapped me into better and better jobs over the next few years, and there's no doubt it changed my life for the better. And if I hadn't physically walked in the damn door I never would have heard of it. It was posted nowhere and didn't even exist as a real opening yet.</p>
<p>That job was incredibly valuable to me, but even MORE valuable was the lesson: application processes are extremely vulnerable to those willing to do a little extra work. If you're willing to be a bit unconventional you can accomplish some amazing things.</p>
<p>Which brings me to RailsConf. The biggest problem with my proposal was it was far too much like every other proposal. I needed to stand out, and preferably in a way that showed I would be a great speaker. So, crafted a plan.</p>
<p>I decided to record a video of the first five minutes of my talk. I put on a nice shirt, gave it a few practice runs, and hit record.</p>
<p>Then I sent this email:</p>
<p>Dear RailsConf Organizers,</p>
<p>I submitted a proposal to give a talk this year.  The title is 'Write code faster: expert-level vim'</p>
<p>I think you should choose me as one of the speakers for this year.  Here's why:</p>
<p>1.  I'd do a great job.  I'm an expert in the topic of my talk, and I know how to present it in an engaging fashion.  I've published a paid screencast on the subject that sold hundreds of copies (to excellent reviews).  Simply put: I'm going to give you a great talk.</p>
<p>2.  I really, really want to speak.  I'm extremely fired up about presenting.  I love my topic and I love teaching it to others.  When RailsConf rolls around you can be damn sure I'll be ready to nail it.</p>
<p>I recorded the 2-minute intro to my talk so you can get a feel for my presentation style.  Here's a link: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg33EQCdMxw</p>
<p>Thanks so much; and I'll see you at the conference either way.</p>
<p>-Ben Orenstein</p>
<p>Here's what I got in response:</p>
<p>Hi Ben!</p>
<p>Thanks for your email, your proposal and the video!  I LOVE what you've done with the video especially :)</p>
<p>We're still working on the program obviously (given that the CFP hasn't closed yet) but we'll definitely give yours an extra-specia -close look.</p>
<p>Chad</p>
<p>Chad Fowler emailed me! Chad Fowler! I literally bragged about this to my friends.</p>
<p>Later, over a barely-functional internet connection in a Chinese hostel I got the wonderful news: I was going to speak at RailsConf!</p>
<p>There is simply no doubt that my video was a huge part of the reason I got the gig. As far as I know I was the only person to do this. Everyone else was competing with text against 24 frames per second. Instead of being proposal number thirty I was video number ONLY. Not only was it unique, but it let me demonstrate that I could do the job.</p>
<p>If it weren't a tired aphorism, I'd tell you that the difference between ordinary and extraordinary is that little extra. It probably took me an hour to put together my video, but made all the difference in getting what I wanted.</p>
<p>I included the story about my first internship because I want you to realize that this sort of hacking is almost always possible. So please, get in the habit of ignoring the usual way of doing things. Laugh off required credentials. Chuckle at resumes and cover letters. Walk past the receptionist and get what you want.</p>
<p>Oh, and my RailsConf talk? I think I nailed it.</p>
