<p>If you're looking for a way to contribute back to Rails, the quickest way to get your first patch in is by <strong>improving its documentation</strong>.</p>
<p>Some people don't find patching documentation as sexy as slinging code, but I've come to love the humble doc patch. Here's <strong>why they're so great</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>It's easy to get started</strong>. Your first patch can be as simple as fixing a typo in a <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/">Rails Guide</a>. Later, when you're feeling more at ease with the process, you can improve the documentation for a class or method right in the code. Find an undocumented class, dig into its guts, and write a good summary. Ever read the examples for a method and think they could be improved? Don't grimace and move on; fix it!</p>
<p><strong>Your patch will be merged in quickly</strong>. All patches to Rails' documentation go into the <a href="https://github.com/lifo/docrails">docrails</a> repository. This repo has an OPEN COMMIT POLICY: you simply message lifo on github and he'll give you commit rights. You can make your patches at will, and the repo is regularly merged with the official Rails repository (<a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/8b5dc9caa52a2877e3ecc207515fd156abad45e0">here's the most recent example</a> of that happening). There's no lengthy signoff process, so your commits will never languish while waiting for "+1s" or attention from a core member.</p>
<p><strong>Most people don't want to do it. </strong>It's actually pretty tough to find bugs in Rails to fix. There are so many Rubyists crawling all over it that there's just not that much low-hanging fruit to patch. However, most developers don't really like writing prose, so there's a lot of easily-improved or outright missing documentation out there.</p>
<p><strong>Your commits count toward the Rails contributors <a href="http://contributors.rubyonrails.org/">leader board</a></strong>. If you're into that sort of ladder-climbing, you can break into a top 200 spot with just 8 commits. With just a bit of effort I reached 267th, which gets me laid <em>all </em>the time.</p>
<p>It feels damn good to give back to projects you use every day, and seeing your name in the commit logs is a real trip at first. If you've been looking to start making some open-source contributions, you could do a lot worse than improving documentation used by thousands.</p>
<p>If I've inspired you, <strong>you should start here: the <a href="http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/contributing_to_rails.html#contributing-to-the-rails-documentation">Contributing to Rails Guide</a></strong> has a section specifically for working on documentation. Good luck!</p>
