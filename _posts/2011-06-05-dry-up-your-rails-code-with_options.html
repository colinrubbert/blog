<p>Did you know you can refactor this:<br />
<code lang="ruby"><br />
# Duplicated :dependent => :destroy option.<br />
class Account < ActiveRecord::Base<br />
  has_many :customers, :dependent => :destroy<br />
  has_many :products,  :dependent => :destroy<br />
  has_many :invoices,  :dependent => :destroy<br />
  has_many :expenses,  :dependent => :destroy<br />
end<br />
</code></p>
<p>into this?<br />
<code lang="ruby"><br />
# Nice and DRY!<br />
class Account < ActiveRecord::Base<br />
  with_options :dependent => :destroy do |assoc|<br />
    assoc.has_many :customers<br />
    assoc.has_many :products<br />
    assoc.has_many :invoices<br />
    assoc.has_many :expenses<br />
  end<br />
end<br />
</code></p>
<p>The with_options method is a really cool chunk of code that lets you DRY up duplication that sometimes appear when passing the same options to a series of methods.</p>
<p>But the point of this post is <strong>how it works behind the scenes</strong>, so check out this 11-minute code walkthrough:</p>
