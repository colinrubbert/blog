<p><span style="font-weight: bold"></span>I'm a big fan of heuristics.</p>
<p>This word tends to get used in several different ways, so let's disambiguate.</p>
<p>One definition is that heuristics are an informal guide to problems or situations.  This class could be described as "rules of thumb."  An example that you're likely familiar with is Moore's Law.  Don't let the Law part fool you, it's simply a guide yielding a good guess.  It's a heuristic.</p>
<p>Another definition occurs in algorithms.  Here, a heuristic is a function that guides a search by calculating a measure of how promising each potential path looks.  The heuristic boils everything down to one number for each path and you simply pick the highest one.</p>
<p>These definitions share something: they both involve a reduction of complexity.  The situation is simplified by the willful throwing-out of quite a lot of information.</p>
<p>Turns out this is a good thing.</p>
<p>The "rule of thumb" type heuristics let you make better decisions without doing lots of learning first.  I'm not much of a chef, but if I want to cook a turkey I know I'm going need about 20 minutes per pound at 325.  This rule might not give optimal results, but it covers the majority of cases and can easily remembered or passed on.  (For a huge trove of these sort of rules, check out www.rulesofthumb.org)</p>
<p>In algorithms, a good heuristic lets you reduce quite a lot of problems into basic search.  Write me a good heuristic and I'll give you a mean chess engine.  Conversely, the lack of a quality heuristic can be deadly.  People are still struggling to write a good AI to play the game of Go, partly because it's so difficult to write a function to evaluate a given position.  Human players can use a sort of fuzzy pattern recognition, or intuition.  But computers have no such option, so I could still beat Deep Blue at a go board.</p>
<p>&lt;add a suit should cost as much as an ounce of gold&gt;</p>
<p>Complexity is indeed the enemy, and heuristics are a great tool for reducing it.  From 1,000 feet up, I may only be able to tell you that the ocean looks blue, but that may just might be all the information you needed.</p>
