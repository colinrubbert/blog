<p>Dear Twitter web folks,</p>

<p>To me, a favorite means "I like this."</p>

<p>A retweet means "I want my followers to see this."</p>

<p>Recently, you've been sharing things I've favorited with my followers. This
merges these two ideas in a way that makes me uncomfortable because I've lost
some control of the message broadcast under my name. Favoriting and retweeting
are now a single, blunter concept.</p>

<p>I'm sure it increases some metrics you care about, but I believe it also
takes a useful distinction and oversimplifies it.</p>

<p>Thoughts?</p>
