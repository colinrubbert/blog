<p>From <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/benjamin_zander_on_music_and_passion.html">Benjamin Zander's effervescent TED talk</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>"I'm not going to go on until every single person in this room [has] come to love and understand classical music. Now you notice that there is not the slightest doubt in my mind that this is going to work.<strong> It's one of the characteristics of a leader that he not doubt for one moment the capacity of the people he's leading to realize whatever he's dreaming</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<p>I'm going to be weaving this idea into <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/rails2010/public/schedule/detail/11284">my upcoming talk at RailsConf</a>.</p>
<p>I have a goal for my audience, and will show no doubt that they can achieve it.Â  Then, I'll make sure they do by giving them the means in my talk.</p>
