<p>Curious about Rails' internals? In the screencast below, I take you on a 5-minute tour of the OrderedOptions and InheritedOptions classes in ActiveSupport. Check it out for a code-level tour of an interesting bit of Rails.</p>
<p>By the way, this is an excerpt of a longer screencast I'm creating of guided tour through the best parts of the Rails source. If you'd like to be notified when the full screencast is released, <a href="http://codeulatescreencasts.wufoo.com/forms/want-an-email-when-the-screencast-is-released/">drop your email in this form</a>. (One email, ever.)</p>

<p>UPDATE: Youtube's compression isn't looking so hot, so if you prefer, you can <a href="http://downloads.codeulatescreencasts.com/ordered_options.mov">download the high quality version here</a>. (43MB)</p>
