First, some exciting news: after a thorough (but enjoyable!) interview process,
I've accepted a position at <a href="http://www.thoughtbot.com">thoughtbot</a>
in Boston and will begin in a few weeks. I can't wait to get started.

The interviews themselves will make great fodder for future posts, but I
realized a startling fact the other day: I never once sent anyone at thoughtbot
a resume.

Moreover, I was never asked about schools, degrees, nor much about my past
experience. My "resume" took the form of links to this blog, some open source
contributions, and access to a couple private github repos of Rails apps I'd
built.

This experience confirms an idea that I'm glad to see gaining ground lately:
resumes are deprecated. Code is king. Oh, and connections help a lot too.

A year ago I wrote that it was possible to <a
  href="http://www.benorenstein.com/blog/land-a-rails-job-with-no-experience/">land
a Rails job with no experience</a>, provided you had a portfolio application,
some code on Github, and attended Ruby meetups to network. Some people were
skeptical, but it was exactly those things that got me my first Rails job. Now,
years later, the same set of things got me in the door at thoughtbot: code,
more code, and the recommendation of thoughtbotter <a
href="http://dancroak.com/">Dan Croak</a>, who I got to know during the '09
Rails Rumble (yet more coding!)

I'm starting to think this really is the secret sauce for professional
programming success, regardless of experience level. Get some code out there
for people to see, and get yourself out there to meet awesome programmers you
might want to work with someday. Leave the bullshitty bullet points to the
MBAs.
