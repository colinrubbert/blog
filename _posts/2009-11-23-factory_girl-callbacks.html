<p><a href="http://www.thoughtbot.com">Thoughtbot</a>'s <a href="http://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl">factory_girl</a> has <a href="http://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl/commit/6e35bf92071f4b34763e6d0d12ebef8f7eab4d4b">recently gotten</a> a terrific new feature: callbacks.</p>
<p>They look like this:<br />
<code lang="ruby">Factory(:user) do |u|<br />
  u.after_create { |user_instance| do_something_to(user_instance) }<br />
end</code><br />
Now, when you use <em>Factory(:user)</em> in your tests, the <em>do_something_to </em>method will be called after the user is saved in the database.  Also notice that you'll be passed the instance of the user as a block parameter.</p>
<p>There are two other callbacks now available: <em>after_build</em> and <em>after_stub</em>.  These fire pretty much where you'd expect them to. (In practice, I really only use after_create.)</p>
<p>You can mix and match these callbacks on the same factory.  Multiple definitions of the same callback will be executed in the order you provide them:<br />
<code lang="ruby">Factory(:user) do |u|<br />
  u.after_build  { |user_instance| do_something_to(user_instance) }<br />
  u.after_create { do_this_after_create }<br />
  u.after_create { then_do_this }<br />
end</code><br />
I'm excited about this addition because of how much more flexibility this gives factory_girl.  There are some kludgy parts of my <em>factories.rb</em> files that will be more elegant when refactored with these methods. Accepting these little lambdas to be run later feels very lispy, something I take as a great sign.</p>
