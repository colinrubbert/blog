<div id="_mcePaste">I just spent the last eight hours in a <a href="http://loft.bocoup.com/intro-to-jquery-2010-10-15/">jQuery</a><a href="http://loft.bocoup.com/intro-to-jquery-2010-10-15/"> training class</a>. I noticed that in some sections I was pretty bored, but in others I was completely engaged.</div>
<p></p>
<div>After a while, I realized I could easily predict whether a section would be interesting or boring with the following heuristic: <strong>slides suck, code rocks</strong>.</div>
<p></p>
<div id="_mcePaste">I think we need to get away from the idea that a bunch of code snippets on slides is a good way to teach programmers. Think about this: if you needed to pick up a new language over the next week, how would you do it?  When programmers want to learn a new language, there's really only one way we can really make progress: we play with it. We load up just a little bit of code, and we poke at it. A question pops into our heads and we find the answer with code. When we've got the basics, we start trying to build bigger things.</div>
<p></p>
<div>If this is the way programmers learn (and I claim that it is), why are we teaching them with snippets on a slide?</div>
<p></p>
<div>My favorite speaker of the day was <a href="http://benalman.com/">Ben</a><a href="http://benalman.com/">Alman</a>. Ben's talks were fantastic for two reasons: first, he was ridiculously knowledgeable about his subject matter. But almost as importantly, he spent a ton of time writing code for us. Everything he talked about was demonstrated on the fly with code running in the browser. Someone asked a question? Ben wrote some code to show him the answer.</div>
<p></p>
<div>After Ben spent five minutes refactoring two functions, I realized I'd learned more in those five minutes than I had in the hour leading up to it. An hour spent reading examples off slides.</div>
<p></p>
<div>I'm starting to think that this should be the go-to move when teaching programmers. Write code in front of us, live. You're allow to screw up; in fact, I hope you do! I'll learn something watching you fix it. This is how you'd teach a friend who'd come by your desk for help. Let's just pretend we're already buddies, and show me some code.</div>
