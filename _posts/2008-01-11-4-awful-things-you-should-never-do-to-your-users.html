<h2><em>"Good manners are made up of petty sacrifices."<br />
-Ralph Waldo Emerson</em></h2>
<p>Emerson was on to something.  To be polite is to make life easier for those around you.  To be rude is simply the opposite.  <strong>In the world of software, the rudest thing you can do is make your users work harder than they absolutely have to.  </strong></p>
<p>Consider this as you read the list below.  I think you'll find it's the common thread in this tapestry of annoyance.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold"></span></p>
<h2><strong> 1.  Make them log in by account number.</strong></h2>
<p>Using a number to identify users makes life easy as a developer.  "Well, we've already got a uid column in the user table, let's just have everyone use that for their login."  Great!  Done.  On to the next feature.</p>
<p>Awful.</p>
<p>Remembering a long string of digits is hard.  Too hard.  Because of this, you have effectively tasked me with keeping track of this number forever.  And I pretty much hate you for it.</p>
<p>If you must start your users off with account numbers, always give them an option to associate some an alpha-numeric user name with it.  <strong>People like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic">mnemonics</a>.  </strong>It's more work, but only for you.</p>
<p>This, by the way, is one reason we're all not using <a href="http://www.icq.com">ICQ</a> today.</p>
<h2><strong>2.  Enforce complex password requirements</strong></h2>
<p><img src="assets/damn_it.jpg" /></p>
<p>This is closely related to the first item.  If you are not holding highly-sensitive data for your users then drop your password complexity requirements, and I mean completely.  If I want to use "Ben" as my password everywhere just let me.  If you enforce arbitrary complexity there's a chance I won't be able to use one of my favorite passwords, and you've again tasked me with recording this information somewhere.</p>
<p>Complex user passwords provide a false sense of security anyhow.   An individual compromised user account is actually no big deal.  What you should really be spending your energies on is making sure no one can steal your <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070109023445/http%3A//reddit.com/blog/theft">entire database of clear-text passwords</a>, or training your employees not to carry sensitive data, unencrypted, on their <a href="http://idtheftsecrets.blogspot.com/2006/09/ge-stolen-laptop-exposes-50000.html">sure-to-be-stolen-someday laptops</a>.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold">3.  Make them confirm their email address to register.</span></h2>
<p>I posted last week that you must <a href="http://codeulate.com/?p=9">relentlessly streamline the process by which users register for your site</a>.  The back and forth to confirm an email is a serious hurdle to throw in front of users who are considering registering.  I often won't sign up for sites just because I <em>assume</em> I'm going to have to go through this dance with them.</p>
<p>Check out this google search for "<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=disposable+email">disposable email</a>."  This is an entire class of web applications spawned simply because people hate confirming their real email address (I recommend <a href="http://www.mailinator.com/">Mailinator</a> by the way.)  When users will invest real effort simply to <em>work around</em> something you've done, you know you have a horrible idea on your hands.</p>
<p>Note: if you simply must confirm email addresses, at least let your users login immediately and go back to what they were doing.  Send the confirmation email immediately, but give them ample time to actually click your message and confirm.</p>
<h2><strong>4.  Make them opt out of being spammed</strong></h2>
<p>I find this one particularly offensive.</p>
<p>I just created a brand new account at Yahoo.  During the process, I was <em>not</em> asked to opt in to any sort of marketing whatsoever.  But check out what I see if I go to my "Marketing preferences" tab.</p>
<p><img src="assets/yahoo_spam.png" /></p>
<p>Wow, thanks guys.  You guessed correctly that I wanted to be signed up for 13 varieties of spam.   By default.  Without notice.</p>
<p>It's crap like this that makes me glad Google is going to slowly crush you out of existence.</p>
<p>Any time you find yourself making a decision that makes you money but will annoy your users <strong>you have just screwed up.</strong></p>
<h3>Let's all just agree to be a little more polite to each other.</h3>
