<p>In May of 2010 I gave a one-hour talk to the Boston Ruby Group titled 'Write Code Faster: Expert-level Vim'.</p>
<p>I'd volunteered to give it as a test-run before delivering the same talk at RailsConf a month later.</p>
<p>Little did I know, someone recorded the Boston.rb talk and it recently surfaced on <a href="http://bostonrb.org/presentations">the presentations page</a>.</p>
<p>If the title sounds interesting, <a href="http://bostonrb.org/presentations/25">go watch the talk!</a></p>
