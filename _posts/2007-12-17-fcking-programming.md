Yesterday I stumbled onto a delightful tool from Google Labs: Code Search
(UPDATE: now defunct).

Turns out Google is now crawling through source code. The
[GoogleBot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Googlebot), in its never-ending quest
for sentience, searches inside tars, zips, and even dives into
[CVS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_Versions_System) and
[Subversion](http://subversion.tigris.org/) repositories. As Code Search is
targeted at programmers, you can perform fantastically powerful queries using
POSIX extended [regular
expressions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression).

Granted access to billions of lines of code and the awesome power of Google's
search technology, I did what any
[rational](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/silly),
[thinking](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/immature) programmer would
do: I typed in some profanity and hit enter.

In tribute to the valiant struggles of coders everywhere, please enjoy:

**The best in programming profanity**

> /* We will NOT put a fucking timestamp in the header here.  
>  Every time you put it back, I will come in and take it out again.  
>  I'm sorry. This field does not belong here. We fill it with a 0 so

> /* Dear free software world, do you NOW see we are fucking

> This job would be great if it wasn't for the fucking customers.  

> /* Boy, would I like to make the thing expire one second ago, or what? Of course I would. But that slimy, stinking, load of pig manure that is called Netscape/1.1N doesn't pay any attention to the seconds part of the time... after all, what's a second or two amongst friends? So, I thought to make it expire one minute ago, but naturally, that didn't work on 1.1N either. Losers. So, I made it expire 24 hours ago, which, if you ask me, is most heinous, considering the Last-Modified date could be later than that. I fucking hate you, you monopolizing piece of Netscape feces. */  

> The fucking JS DOM *changes* based on one or multiple boxes!?!?! Damn damn damn I hate the JavaScript DOM so damn much!!!!!!  

> TODO: this is obviously not right ... this whole fucking module sucks anyway

> // gratuitous hack for Adobe SVG 3, what a fucking POS  

> /* if we get here, there are massive fucking problems, for a start our stack is fucked up, and we can't return(). Just crash out. */  

> /* FIXME: please god, when will the hurting stop? Thus function is so fucking broken it's not even funny. */  

> Note to self: I have no idea what this does anymore. It looks like a cool fucking segment of code though! I just wish I remembered writing it... :-\  

> /* Outlook can't fucking follow RFC if someone PAID them to do it...oh wait, someone paid them NOT to do it. */  

> /* don't fire dem packets too fucking fast */  
>  usleep(1000);  

> fucking imap fucking sucks. what the FUCK kind of committee of dunces designed this shit.  

> Fuck me gently with a chainsaw! Will someone please tell me how the fuck you resize a fucking widget?? Why, when I call whatever resize method I try with 64x64 does the fucking window end up 64x82? WHY???????? WHY???????? WHY???????? WHY???????? WHY???????? WHY???????? (why..?)  

> /* No we fucking don't! DB entries should be stored in the same order as they are in the file ! I can't belive I was so fucking stupid !

> /* 2,191 lines of complete and utter shit coming up... */  

> if (!(ptr = malloc (size)))  
>  /* SHIT! SHIT! SHIT! */  
>  die ("malloc failed");  

And my personal favorite:

> // code below replaces code above - any problems?  
> // yeah, it doesn't fucking work.  

Stay tough out there folks.
