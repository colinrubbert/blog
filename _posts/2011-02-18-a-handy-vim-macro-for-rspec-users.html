<p>In this screencast, I teach how to record a useful vim macro that does a simple RSpec "refactoring".</p>
<p>(You'll want to open it on Youtube and watch in high-resolution.)</p>

<p>Commands used:<br />
7G - jump to line 7<br />
"td - delete into the t register<br />
"tp - put from the t register<br />
qq - start recording a macro (just a series of keystrokes) into register q<br />
@q - execute the keystrokes stored in register q<br />
vmap - set up a mapping active only when in visual mode</p>
