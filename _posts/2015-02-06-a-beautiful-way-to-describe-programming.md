title: A Beautiful Way to Describe Programming

In July of 1986, Hal Abelson and Jay Sussman gave a series of lectures. The
topic was [The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs][lectures].

In the first lecture, Abelson gives a description of programming (which I've
edited lightly) that I don't think has been bested since:

>  Computer science, in some sense, isn't real. You see, when an engineer is
>  designing a physical system, that's made out of real parts. The engineers
>  who worry about that have to address problems of tolerance and approximation
>  and noise in the system.
>
> So for example, as an electrical engineer, I can go off and easily build a
> one-stage amplifier or a two-stage amplifier, and I can imagine cascading a
> lot of them to build a million-stage amplifier. But it's ridiculous to build
> such a thing, because long before the millionth stage, the thermal noise in
> those components way at the beginning is going to get amplified and make the
> whole thing meaningless.
>
> **Computer science deals with idealized components.** We know as much as we
> want about these little program and data pieces that we're fitting things
> together. We don't have to worry about tolerance. And that means that, in
> building a large program, **there's not all that much difference between what
> I can build and what I can imagine.**
>
> So as opposed to other kinds of engineering, where the constraints on what
> you can build are the constraints of physical systems, the constraints of
> physics and noise and approximation, **the constraints imposed in building
> large software systems are the limitations of our own minds.**

It's even better to hear him say it:
