title: Using Social Proof to Get Your Talk Accepted
type: post

Here's a quick tip that will boost the rate at which your talk proposals are
accepted: include proof that you're a good speaker.

I like to use tweets that praise my previous talks. When someone says something
particularly flattering, I save a link. This is doubly true if they're
well-known within the community.

I include the best three with every proposal I send in. I'll say something
simple like "Here's some feedback I received after a recent talk: [links to
flattering things said by cool people]."

Not only are testimonials effective on their own, they're doubly effective
because no one uses them. This makes your application stand out. (You want to
stand out.)

Oh, and if you're brand new to speaking, here's a plan for going from zero to
speaking at a competitive conference:

1. Create a talk. Work hard. Practice a ton.
2. Present to your coworkers.
3. Ask for honest feedback. Shape the talk with it.
4. Present to your local meetup.
5. Ask the audience for honest feedback _and_ to tweet if they liked it.
6. Save the tweets. Apply the feedback.
7. Apply to your dream conference.
8. Get accepted. Prepare to crush it. [Email me](mailto:
