<p>Dear DHH,</p>
<p>I was quite disappointed by your keynote this morning.</p>
<p>What could have been a useful learning session for thousands of Rubyists was instead a lesson in using logical fallacies and questionably-true statements to convince a crowd.</p>
<p>My memory and notes are no doubt imperfect, but I believe this list of fallacies you employed is accurate:</p>
<ul>
<li>TDD believe that unit tests are sufficient for proving correctness. (Strawman: ignores integration tests.)</li>
<p>TDD practitioners judge the value of their tests using only coverage, ratio, and speed of their suite. (Strawman: any myopic approach to a complex process will yield poor results)<br />
Unit tests failed to prevent a bug in Basecamp, therefore they are not useful for proving correctness. (Anecdotal evidence, and mistaking correlation with causation).</p>
<p>Additionally, your examples conflated Dependency Injection with testability, implying that the only way people make code more testable is using DI, and that DI's only benefit is improved testability, neither of which are true.</p>
<p>To be clear, my disappointment is not because I disagree with your thoughts about testing. Rather, I am disappointed in the manner with which you present your argument. I worry quite sincerely that other Rubyists will emulate this faulty way of thinking and arguing, and that our community will be worse off for it.  </p>
<p>(Once more, because this is the sort of thing that always gets missed when you criticize someone's approach to arguing.) I'm not offering this feedback because I disagree with what you've said about TDD. Instead, I'm disappointed in the devices you used to try to convince the audience of the validity of your points. </p>
<p>I think you can do better, and hope you will.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br />
Ben Orenstein
</ul>
